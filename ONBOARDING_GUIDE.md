## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Automatic Flow
```
App Launch â†’ Check AsyncStorage â†’ Show Onboarding (if first time) â†’ Main App
```

### Files Created
- `src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Main onboarding component
- `src/components/AppInitializer.tsx` - Wrapper that manages onboarding flow
- `src/utils/onboardingUtils.ts` - Utility functions for managing onboarding state
- `src/components/OnboardingSettings.tsx` - Optional settings component for reset

### Integration
The onboarding is automatically integrated into your app through `App.tsx`:

```tsx
<AppInitializer>
  <AppNavigator />
</AppInitializer>
```

## ðŸ”§ Testing & Development

### Reset Onboarding (Development)
In development mode, you can reset onboarding by calling:
```javascript
global.resetOnboarding()
```

### Manual Reset Component
Add the `OnboardingSettings` component to any settings screen:
```tsx
import { OnboardingSettings } from '../components/OnboardingSettings';

// In your settings screen
<OnboardingSettings onOnboardingReset={() => console.log('Reset!')} />
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

### Colors & Themes
The onboarding uses your app's color scheme from `constants/theme.ts`:
- Primary, Secondary, Success, Accent colors for backgrounds
- White text and icons for contrast
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Animation Timing
- **Entrance**: 800ms fade-in with spring scale
- **Pulse**: 1.5s repeating pulse for medical icon
- **Rotation**: 8s continuous rotation for shield
- **Page transitions**: Smooth spring animations

### Content
Easy to modify in `OnboardingScreen.tsx`:
```tsx
const pages: OnboardingPage[] = [
  {
    title: 'Your Title',
    subtitle: 'Your description',
    backgroundColor: Colors.primary,
    icon: 'your-icon-name',
  },
  // Add more slides...
];
```

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Added
- `react-native-onboarding-swiper` - Onboarding library (can be removed if using custom implementation)
- `lottie-react-native` - Animation library for Lottie files (optional)

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience
- **Skip option** available on all slides
- **Next/Previous navigation** with animated buttons
- **Progress indicators** with animated dots
- **Gesture support** for swiping between slides
- **Automatic save** when completed or skipped

The onboarding creates an excellent first impression and guides users through your app's key features with beautiful animations and smooth transitions!
